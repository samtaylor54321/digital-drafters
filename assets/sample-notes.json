It says that a person is guilty of theft if they take something that belongs to someone else, with the intention of keeping it permanently and depriving the owner of it. This applies whether the person who took the item was trying to gain something for themselves or not. The following sections of the Act provide more details and rules related to this definition of theft."}, "1": {"original": "2 1 A person\u2019s appropriation of property belonging to another is not to be regarded as dishonest\u2014 a if he appropriates the property in the belief that he has in law the right to deprive the other of it, on behalf of himself or of a third person; or b if he appropriates the property in the belief that he would have the other\u2019s consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it; or c (except where the property came to him as trustee or personal representative) if he appropriates the property in the belief that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps. 2 A person\u2019s appropriation of property belonging to another may be dishonest notwithstanding that he is willing to pay for the property.", "explanation": "Here is a summary of the text in layman's terms:\n\nThe law does not consider a person's actions to be dishonest if they took someone else's property, as long as they believed they had the legal right to do so, either for themselves or on behalf of someone else. It's also not considered dishonest if they believed the owner would have given them permission if they knew about it, or if they believed the owner couldn't be found after reasonable efforts.\n\nHowever, a person's actions can still be considered dishonest even if they were willing to pay for the property they took. The key factor is their belief about whether they had the legal right to take it."}, "2": {"original": "3 1 Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner. 2 Where property or a right or interest in property is or purports to be transferred for value to a person acting in good faith, no later assumption by him of rights which he believed himself to be acquiring shall, by reason of any defect in the transferor\u2019s title, amount to theft of the property.", "explanation": "Here's a simplified summary of the text:\n\n1. Whenever someone acts as if they own something, even if they obtained it innocently, that's considered appropriation or taking ownership of it, regardless of whether they actually stole it.\n\n2. However, if someone in good faith receives property or a right to property in exchange for value (like paying for it), and they believe they're acquiring those rights, then their later assumption of those rights won't be considered theft, even if the original owner's title to the property was defective.\n\nIn other words, the text is discussing the concept of appropriation and how it applies to people who come into possession of property, either legitimately or not. It also addresses situations where someone innocently acquires property and then claims ownership, which may not necessarily be considered theft."}, "3": {"original": "4 1 \u201c Property \u201d includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property. 2 A person cannot steal land, or things forming part of land and severed from it by him or by his directions, except in the following cases, that is to say\u2014 a when he is a trustee or personal representative, or is authorised by power of attorney, or as liquidator of a company, or otherwise, to sell or dispose of land belonging to another, and he appropriates the land or anything forming part of it by dealing with it in breach of the confidence reposed in him; or b when he is not in possession of the land and appropriates anything forming part of the land by severing it or causing it to be severed, or after it has been severed; or c when, being in possession of the land under a tenancy, he appropriates the whole or part of any fixture or structure let to be used with the land. For purposes of this subsection \u201c land \u201d does not include incorporeal hereditaments; \u201c tenancy \u201d means a tenancy for years or any less period and includes an agreement for such a tenancy, but a person who after the end of a tenancy remains in possession as statutory tenant or otherwise is to be treated as having possession under the tenancy, and \u201c let \u201d shall be construed accordingly. 3 A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose. For purposes of this subsection \u201c mushroom \u201d includes any fungus, and \u201c plant \u201d includes any shrub or tree. 4 Wild creatures, tamed or untamed, shall be regarded as property; but a person cannot steal a wild creature not tamed nor ordinarily kept in captivity, or the carcase of any such creature, unless either it has been reduced into possession by or on behalf of another person and possession of it has not since been lost or abandoned, or another person is in course of reducing it into possession.", "explanation": "Here's a summary in layman's terms:\n\n1. \"Property\" includes money, real estate, personal belongings, and intangible assets.\n\n2.

If they don't have possession of the land and take things attached to it.\n   c. If they have a rental agreement for the land and take fixtures or structures on the property.\n\n3. Picking wild mushrooms, flowers, fruit, or foliage is not considered stealing, unless it's done for a commercial purpose.\n\n4. Wild animals, whether tamed or untamed, are considered property.

Property is considered to belong to someone if they have possession, control, or a legal right or interest in it (not just an agreement to transfer it).\n\n2.

If someone receives property from someone else and has an obligation to handle it in a specific way, then as far as that person is concerned, the property belongs to the original owner.\n\n4. If someone gets property by mistake and is obligated to return all or part of it, then to that extent the property is considered to belong to the person who is owed the restoration. Trying not to make the restoration is seen as trying to deprive that person of the property.\n\n5. Property of a corporation that has no current leader is still considered to belong to the corporation."}}
