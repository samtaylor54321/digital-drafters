The purpose of the appropriation, whether for personal gain or benefit, is irrelevant. The subsequent sections of the Act provide further guidance on the interpretation and application of this definition of theft."}, "1": {"original": "2 1 A person\u2019s appropriation of property belonging to another is not to be regarded as dishonest\u2014 a if he appropriates the property in the belief that he has in law the right to deprive the other of it, on behalf of himself or of a third person; or b if he appropriates the property in the belief that he would have the other\u2019s consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it; or c (except where the property came to him as trustee or personal representative) if he appropriates the property in the belief that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps. 2 A person\u2019s appropriation of property belonging to another may be dishonest notwithstanding that he is willing to pay for the property.", "explanation": "The summary is as follows:\n\nThe appropriation of property belonging to another is not considered dishonest if the person believes they have the legal right to do so, or if they believe the owner would consent to the appropriation if they knew the circumstances. This exception does not apply if the person is a trustee or personal representative. Additionally, the appropriation may still be considered dishonest even if the person is willing to pay for the property."}, "2": {"original": "3 1 Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner. 2 Where property or a right or interest in property is or purports to be transferred for value to a person acting in good faith, no later assumption by him of rights which he believed himself to be acquiring shall, by reason of any defect in the transferor\u2019s title, amount to theft of the property.", "explanation": "The summary is as follows:\n\nThe assumption of ownership rights over property, regardless of how the property was obtained, constitutes an appropriation. However, when property is transferred in good faith to a person acting in good faith, any later assumption of rights by that person does not amount to theft, even if the transferor's title was defective."}, "3": {"original": "4 1 \u201c Property \u201d includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property. 2 A person cannot steal land, or things forming part of land and severed from it by him or by his directions, except in the following cases, that is to say\u2014 a when he is a trustee or personal representative, or is authorised by power of attorney, or as liquidator of a company, or otherwise, to sell or dispose of land belonging to another, and he appropriates the land or anything forming part of it by dealing with it in breach of the confidence reposed in him; or b when he is not in possession of the land and appropriates anything forming part of the land by severing it or causing it to be severed, or after it has been severed; or c when, being in possession of the land under a tenancy, he appropriates the whole or part of any fixture or structure let to be used with the land. For purposes of this subsection \u201c land \u201d does not include incorporeal hereditaments; \u201c tenancy \u201d means a tenancy for years or any less period and includes an agreement for such a tenancy, but a person who after the end of a tenancy remains in possession as statutory tenant or otherwise is to be treated as having possession under the tenancy, and \u201c let \u201d shall be construed accordingly. 3 A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose. For purposes of this subsection \u201c mushroom \u201d includes any fungus, and \u201c plant \u201d includes any shrub or tree. 4 Wild creatures, tamed or untamed, shall be regarded as property; but a person cannot steal a wild creature not tamed nor ordinarily kept in captivity, or the carcase of any such creature, unless either it has been reduced into possession by or on behalf of another person and possession of it has not since been lost or abandoned, or another person is in course of reducing it into possession.", "explanation": "The summary for the policy expert is as follows:\n\nProperty includes money, real estate, personal belongings, and other intangible assets. However, there are specific cases where a person cannot be charged with stealing land or items that are part of the land. This includes when the person has been authorized to sell or dispose of the land, or when the person is not in possession of the land and appropriates items that have been severed from it. Additionally, a person who picks wild mushrooms, flowers, fruit, or foliage for personal use, and not for commercial purposes, is not considered to have stolen these items. Wild creatures, whether tamed or untamed, are also considered property, but a person cannot be charged with stealing a wild creature that has not been reduced into possession by another person."}, "4": {"original": "5 1 Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest). 2 Where property is subject to a trust, the persons to whom it belongs shall be regarded as including any person having a right to enforce the trust, and an intention to defeat the trust shall be regarded accordingly as an intention to deprive of the property any person having that right. 3 Where a person receives property from or on account of another, and is under an obligation to the other to retain and deal with that property or its proceeds in a particular way, the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the other. 4 Where a person gets property by another\u2019s mistake, and is under an obligation to make restoration (in whole or in part) of the property or its proceeds or of the value thereof, then to the extent of that obligation the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the person entitled to restoration, and an intention not to make restoration shall be regarded accordingly as an intention to deprive that person of the property or proceeds. 5 Property of a corporation sole shall be regarded as belonging to the corporation notwithstanding a vacancy in the corporation.", "explanation": "The summary is as follows:\n\nThe text outlines the legal principles for determining who \"owns\" or has a claim over property. It states that possession, control, or a proprietary right over property is considered ownership, even if the person does not have full legal title.

Additionally, the text provides that the property of a corporation sole belongs to the corporation, even during a vacancy."}}
