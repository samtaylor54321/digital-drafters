    # define prompt
    prompt = f"Please summarise the {bill.title.string}, sections 1 - {max_section}, which is included below, so it's understandable for a policy expert who is not a legal expert. The commentary must never simply restate what the bill says, but should stand back from the detail of the provision and try to summarise it in one or two sentences, using everyday language. The notes must be neutral in tone (ie they do not go into political lines about the merits of the policy, though the practical outcomes should be spelled out), written in plain language, with short sentences and paragraphs. It is important to avoid jargon and to explain the meaning of any technical or legal terms and any acronyms or other abbreviations. The purpose of the commentary is also to add value â€“ what will it be helpful for the reader to know that is not apparent from reading the bill itself. In your output, start with the name of the bill and the sections included in the summary. Do not include an acknowledgement of this prompt, nor say 'the summary of this bill is':\n"
